# Expense Analysis

It's the new year! What's more exhilarating than looking back to evaluate how well one has accomplished in his/her financial goals? A lot, actually. In fact, a quarter of millenials in Singapore doesn't keep track of how much they are spending ([Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1101386/singapore-millennial-attitudes-toward-spending/#statisticContainer)). Money is important, so why isn't everyone checking how much money is flowing out of one's pocket? One possible explanation could be that it simply takes a lot of time and effort to do so. Specifically, if one wishes to examine his/her monthly bank statements, it's daunting to manually consolidate lines of transactions and then compare them to a preset budget. Perhaps a better way would be to first copy and paste each line to a separate spreadsheet program, afterwhich numerous aggregations can be easily performed within the program. However, imagine having to repeatedly copy and paste line after line from a single statement like this:
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/DBS_statement_ex1.png)
(an example of a PDF statement from DBS. Note that some amounts have been fabricated as I don't want people to judge me and my spending habits)
